<h1>The Best Novels According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top novels of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Nightingale</h3>
<p>This is my favourite novel so far, I've read it three times and every time I read it I cried and lived in the novel. I am simply in love with it.</p>
<h3>Death on the Nile</h3>
<p>I read this novel years ago, I don't remember anything about it except that I loved it and was obsessed.</p>
<h3>Midnight Flight</h3>
<p>As you might have noticed, I don't remember the name but what I remember is me not being able to look down.</p>
<h3>Rob3 Gram</h3>
<p>It's a novel about drug abuse. I actually listened to its Audiobook, I haven't read it. It was a journey, I lived every details and struggle the main character lived, although I was so young while reading it.</p>
<h3>Sane3 Elzalam</h3>
<p>The best horror-historical novel EVER.</p>
<h3>Nadia</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about it. I only remember waiting impatiently for the next audio book episode to upload.</p>
<h3>Ith ma</h3>
<p>A novel about remembering how fun it was when you were young, an awesome book that I would read ever couple of years to remember how having fun felt like.</p>
